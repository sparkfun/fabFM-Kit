*FabFM Radio Kit (KIT-11043)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11043)

The FabFM is a stylish FM radio kit that can be built with just basic soldering tools. The PCB is all PTH, meaning that even a beginner solderer can put this kit together with a little time. The wooden, laser cut frame doesn't take any tools or glue to put together, each part press-fits into another. Once assembled the FabFM Radio Kit produces a fully functioning, old-school style FM radio.
